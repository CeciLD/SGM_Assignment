The Last Man Standing

To play the game you need 2-4 joysticks, depending on how many people would like to play. The objective of each player is to knock out all the other players off the platforms and be (as the title suggests) the last man standing. To do this, you can acquire powerups by killing the birds that are flying over the map, therefore increase their chances of winning.

Controls:
Move left and right with the Right joystick
Jump with the Left Button (LB)
Shoot with the Right Button (RB)
Aim with the Right joystick
